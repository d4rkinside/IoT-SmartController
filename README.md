# IoT-SmartController
This is an Blynk Cloud based Iot project that i have built to control the power appliances in my house using the nodeMCU(ESP8266)
I have used 4 relays that connect to the switches on the electrical board on the wall to enable me to control even the non-smart devices thru my smartphone and PC 
using a wireless connection
